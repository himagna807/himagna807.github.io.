                Humans are hard-wired to dream, to create, to innovate. Each of us seeks to do work that gives us
                purpose — to write a great novel, to make a discovery, to build strong communities, to care for the
                sick. The urge to connect to the core of our work lives in all of us. But today, we spend too much time
                consumed by the drudgery of work on tasks that zap our time, creativity and energy. To reconnect to the
                soul of our work, we don't just need a better way of doing the same things. We need a whole new way to
                work.

                Today, we are bringing the power of next-generation AI to work. Introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot — your
                copilot for work. It combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with your data in the Microsoft
                Graph and the Microsoft 365 apps to turn your words into the most powerful productivity tool on the
                planet.

                “Today marks the next major step in the evolution of how we interact with computing, which will
                fundamentally change the way we work and unlock a new wave of productivity growth,” said Satya Nadella,
                Chairman and CEO, Microsoft. “With our new copilot for work, we're giving people more agency and making
                technology more accessible through the most universal interface — natural language.”

                Copilot is integrated into Microsoft 365 in two ways. It works alongside you, embedded in the Microsoft
                365 apps you use every day — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams and more — to unleash creativity,
                unlock productivity and uplevel skills. Today we're also announcing an entirely new experience: Business
                Chat. Business Chat works across the LLM, the Microsoft 365 apps, and your data — your calendar, emails,
                chats, documents, meetings and contacts — to do things you've never been able to do before. You can give
                it natural language prompts like “Tell my team how we updated the product strategy,” and it will
                generate a status update based on the morning's meetings, emails and chat threads.

                With Copilot, you're always in control. You decide what to keep, modify or discard. Now, you can be more
                creative in Word, more analytical in Excel, more expressive in PowerPoint, more productive in Outlook
                and more collaborative in Teams.

                    ChatGPT is a generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched in
                    2022. It is based on the GPT-4o large language model (LLM). ChatGPT can generate human-like
                    conversational responses, and enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired
                    length, format, style, level of detail, and language. It is credited with accelerating the AI boom,
                    which has led to ongoing rapid investment in and public attention to the field of artificial
                    intelligence. Some observers have raised concern about the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs
                    to displace human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.
                    ChatGPT is built on OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models,
                    and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised learning and
                    reinforcement learning from human feedback. Successive user prompts and replies are considered at
                    each conversation stage as context.] ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview,
                    but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. Users on its free
                    tier can access GPT-4o. The ChatGPT subscriptions "Plus", "Team", and "Enterprise" provide
                    additional features such as DALL-E 3 image generation and an increased usage limit.

                        Until now, the standard approach to creating multimodal models involved training separate
                        components for different modalities and then stitching them together to roughly mimic some
                        of this functionality. These models can sometimes be good at performing certain tasks, like
                        describing images, but struggle with more conceptual and complex reasoning. We designed
                        Gemini to be natively multimodal, pre-trained from the start on different modalities. Then
                        we fine-tuned it with additional multimodal data to further refine its effectiveness. This
                        helps Gemini seamlessly understand and reason about all kinds of inputs from the ground up,
                        far better than existing multimodal models — and its capabilities are state of the art in
                        nearly every domain. Learn more about Gemini's capabilities and see how it works. Gemini
                        1.0's sophisticated multimodal reasoning capabilities can help make sense of complex written
                        and visual information. This makes it uniquely skilled at uncovering knowledge that can be
                        difficult to discern amid vast amounts of data. Its remarkable ability to extract insights
                        from hundreds of thousands of documents through reading, filtering and understanding
                        information will help deliver new breakthroughs at digital speeds in many fields from
                        science to finance.

                            Jasper Technologies, Inc., formerly Jasper Wireless, Inc., was an American software
                            developer that provided a cloud-based software platform for the Internet of Things (IoT).
                            Jasper's platform was designed to aid in launching, managing, and monetizing the deployment
                            of IoT for enterprise businesses. Founded in 2004, Jasper partners with over 120
                            mobile operator networks to serve IoT and machine-to-machine (M2M) companies in different
                            industries, including automotive, home security and automation, agriculture, food and
                            beverage, wearable technology, healthcare, advertising and industrial equipment.

                            On February 3, 2016, CISCO Systems announced its plans to acquire Jasper for $1.4 billion.
                            The deal was finalized on March 22, 2016. With the acquisition, Jasper became the IoT Cloud
                            business unit within CISCO. Jasper's CEO, Jahangir Mohammed, is now the GM of the IoT
                            Cloud business unit - reporting to Rowan Trollope, SVP of the IoT and Collaboration
                            Technology Group at CISCO.
